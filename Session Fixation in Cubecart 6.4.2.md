# Description
Cubecart 6.4.2 allows someone to fixate (aka find or set) another userâ€™s session ID which permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session.

# Steps to Reproduce Bug
1- Intercept login

2- Set cookie value to 12345

3- In browser, open developer tools=> session storage and you can see cookie is set to 12345.

# Fix Implemented
https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/aac7b3a13a43e302d91f94a120417b2fda737d0f

# Impact
A successful session fixation attack gives the attacker access to the victim's account. This could mean access to higher level privileges or the ability to look at sensitive data.
